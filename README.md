# Basic CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a basic CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ in order for me to learn more about the language, the standard library and bitwise operations. Based on [this guide](https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/) from the [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repo.
